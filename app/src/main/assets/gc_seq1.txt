“Who is this... and how did you get this application?! No, no, this just won't do... I'm not the type to be condescending but I don't know if you have what it takes. This work requires a truly talented person, someone both physically and mentally exceptional... I suppose you are all that we have to work with... What?! This doesn't make sense, I re-calibrated the entire machine...  He... it... can't know what we are up to!! It appears he is cracking into my system... again... I fear this line is not secure! You have been compromised!! Listen very closely... My name is Professor Wolfe. I have loaded special software to your device... I have also installed a network of paranormal signature imagers throughout the city. We can use these to capture paranormal impressions to your device. These tools will be essential to our success. I have calculated that there is going to be another ritual murder. You must stop it. I can protect you using my machine. Meet me at Ryerson Theatre... meet me as soon as you can. We've got to stop him! Time is running out.
