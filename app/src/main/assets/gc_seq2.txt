"7, can you hear me? Oh this is horrible. Absolutly catastrophic. You took too long. I had to return to the laboratory to attend to the machine. Listen, 7. Do not be alarmed. You are in grave danger. I am reading an extremely aggressive paranormal energy in your vicinity. He's aware of your presence. Do exactly as I instruct. Do you hear me?!! Exactly as I say. Fortunatly for you, I've eqipped your device with a tool that can track this entity. Use the Ghost Catcher to capture the spirit, but you've agitated it. There isn't much time. Move quickly."
