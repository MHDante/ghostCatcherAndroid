You're in big trouble! Don't you trust me? Is it because I killed my Daddy? 7, Spirit X is really mad for what you did! He is going to come back for you with the other spirits from the land of the whispers... Then it will be too late... We have to obey Spirit X when he calls us.  Go to the church before Spirit X comes back. We can talk safely there... for a while... but hurry before its too late!
